        <h2>Our History</h2>
        <p>Founded in 1993 by Karen and Haskell McLendon, <strong>A Caring Manor</strong> was the very first residential
          care home established in Queen Creek, Arizona. What began as a vision of intimate, compassionate care soon
          became a cornerstone in the community. With over 30 years of trusted service, we continue to uphold the values
          they instilled—warmth, dignity, and family-centered support.
        </p>

        <p>The legacy was lovingly passed on to their daughter and son-in-law, Yvonne and Jim Dudley, who now oversee the
          original home. A second home—<em>A Caring Manor II</em>—was later established by their daughter and son-in-law,
          Alisha and Danny Loosemore. Today, both homes remain in the family, with the next generation actively learning
          the craft of care. This is not a business for us—it’s a family tradition.

      <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>At A Caring Manor, we believe that <strong>family isn’t just about blood—it’s about belonging</strong>. Our
          residents become part of our daily lives and our traditions. Whether it’s gathering around for holiday meals or
          celebrating milestones together, there’s always room for another chair at the table.
        </p>

        <p>We pride ourselves on offering more than just care—we offer quality of life. We’ve seen residents thrive when
          given proper attention, meaningful interaction, and the time and space to heal. In many cases, our staff has
          helped restore years of life, simply by reducing dependency on unnecessary medication and nurturing wellness
          with patience and purpose.

        <h2>Care Through Generations</h2>
        <p>The principles of care first taught by our founders have been passed down—mother to daughter, sister to sister,
          husband to wife. That same knowledge and commitment is now being passed to the next generation of caregivers in
          our family. When you choose A Caring Manor, you’re not just selecting a care home—you’re becoming part of a
          legacy of love.
