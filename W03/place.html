              <p>This is the temple where Jasta's father proposed to her mother in 1996. Her mother says it was a cloudy day, but as she turned to see him on one knee the clouds parted and a beam of sun washed over them. When Jasta was young her family would take day trips to this temple so her parents could do temple work. She remembers the view of the beautiful building from the highway after the long car ride. Her and her brothers would play and nap in the thick green grass while her parents took turns going in.</p>
